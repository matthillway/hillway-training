        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="2" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about what 'token' means in the context of how AI reads text." data-hint2="A token is smaller than a word &mdash; roughly 3/4 of a word.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 2 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is a "token" in the context of AI language models?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) A security credential used to log into Claude</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) A unit of currency used to pay for AI usage</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) A small piece of text (roughly 3/4 of a word) that the model processes</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) A type of AI model</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Tokens</strong> are the small pieces of text that AI models break language into for processing. One token is roughly three-quarters of a word. Claude's context window of ~200,000 tokens means it can process about 500 pages of text at once.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="3" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about a specific type of error AI makes with confidence." data-hint2="The word comes from seeing things that are not there &mdash; like a mirage.">

            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) When the AI confidently presents incorrect or fabricated information</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">A <strong>hallucination</strong> is when an AI model generates information that sounds plausible and confident but is actually incorrect or entirely made up. This is why human review of all AI output is essential, especially in professional work.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="4" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Claude's context window is approximately 200,000 tokens. How many pages is that?" data-hint2="One page is roughly 400 tokens. Do the maths: 200,000 / 400 = ?">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 4 of 12</div>

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">Claude's context window of approximately 200,000 tokens translates to roughly <strong>500 pages</strong> of text. This is what makes it excellent for analysing long leases, reports, and other property documents.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="5" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about the three-tier naming convention: small, medium, large." data-hint2="This model is described as our 'daily driver' &mdash; the balanced middle option.">

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Sonnet</strong> is Hillway's default model &mdash; the best balance of speed, quality, and cost. Haiku is used for quick, simple tasks, and Opus is reserved for complex analysis and strategic decisions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="6" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="This is about a training method unique to Anthropic." data-hint2="The method involves a set of principles or rules that guide the AI's behaviour &mdash; like a written 'code of conduct'.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 6 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What training approach does Anthropic use that sets Claude apart from competitors?</div>

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Constitutional AI</strong> is Anthropic's approach where Claude is given a set of principles (a "constitution") that guide its behaviour &mdash; including being helpful, harmless, and honest. This makes Claude more reliable and less likely to produce harmful content.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="7" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about what requires human experience, physical presence, and professional qualification." data-hint2="Which of these requires a RICS-qualified surveyor's professional opinion?">

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">A formal <strong>property valuation</strong> requires professional judgement, local market knowledge, site inspection, and a qualified surveyor's signature. AI can help with research and drafting, but the professional opinion must always come from a qualified human.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="8" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about the process of generating a response &mdash; it is not searching a database." data-hint2="The model generates text piece by piece, predicting what comes next. What is this process called?">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 8 of 12</div>

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Inference</strong> is the process of generating a response. The model takes your input, processes it against its trained knowledge, and generates output token by token. This is different from searching a database &mdash; the response is generated fresh each time.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="9" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about what AI that can only do specific tasks is called, versus hypothetical AI that can do anything." data-hint2="The current type of AI &mdash; including Claude &mdash; is described as 'narrow' because it focuses on specific capabilities.">

            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Robotic AI designed for physical tasks</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">Claude is <strong>narrow AI</strong> &mdash; it excels at language tasks (reading, writing, analysing, summarising) but cannot perform physical tasks, drive a car, or do anything outside its language capabilities. General AI (AGI) does not exist yet.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="10" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="This is about what you should always do, regardless of how good the AI output looks." data-hint2="The golden rule at Hillway is: AI produces drafts, not final products.">
