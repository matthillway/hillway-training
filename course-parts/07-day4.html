        <h2>Co-work Basics</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Up until now, you have been working with Claude Code in a request-response pattern: you ask something, Claude does it, you ask the next thing. <strong>Co-work mode</strong> changes this dynamic. Instead of sequential requests, you and Claude work on the same task simultaneously &mdash; like having a colleague sitting next to you.</p>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>What is Co-work Mode?</h4>
        <p>Co-work mode is a way of using Claude Code where you maintain an ongoing conversation while Claude works on tasks in the background. You can continue giving instructions, ask questions, and refine direction while Claude is actively working. Think of it as pair-working with an AI colleague.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>When to Use Co-work Mode</h3>

            <tr>
              <td>Tasks where you want to guide direction as you go</td>

            <tr>

<strong>Claude:</strong> [Lists property management services]

<strong>You:</strong> Good. Add building surveying services too &mdash; they mentioned some units need condition surveys. Now let's work on pricing. Our standard PM fee is 8% of rent collected for portfolios under 10 units.

<strong>Claude:</strong> [Calculates fees based on rent schedule]

<strong>You:</strong> That total looks right but round the building surveying fees to the nearest &pound;50. Also, add a 10% discount for the first year as we discussed.

          <li>What items should be on the inspection checklist?</li>
          <li>What equipment do you need?</li>

    <!-- Section 15: Agent Teams -->

      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">15</span>
        <h2>Agent Teams</h2>
      </div>

      <p>One of Claude Code's most powerful features is <strong>agent teams</strong> &mdash; the ability to spin up multiple AI agents that work together on a task. Instead of one Claude doing everything sequentially, several specialised agents can work in parallel, each focusing on their area of expertise.</p>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>What is an Agent Team?</h4>
        <p>An agent team is a group of specialised AI agents coordinated by a lead agent. Each team member has a specific role (researcher, analyst, writer, reviewer) and they communicate with each other to complete complex tasks faster and more thoroughly than a single agent could. Think of it like delegating work to a team of specialists.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How Agent Teams Work</h3>

      <div class="step-list">
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>You give a command</strong>
            <p>You invoke a team skill (like <code class="inline">/team</code> or <code class="inline">/audit</code>)</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">2</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>The lead agent plans the work</strong>
            <p>A team lead agent breaks the task into sub-tasks and assigns them to specialist agents</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">3</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>Agents work in parallel</strong>
            <p>Multiple agents work simultaneously &mdash; one researching, one analysing, one drafting</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">4</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>Results are combined</strong>
            <p>The lead agent compiles the results into a coherent output and presents it to you</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>When Agent Teams Add Value</h3>

      <p>Agent teams are most valuable for tasks that benefit from multiple perspectives or parallel processing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Property research</strong> &mdash; One agent checks VOA data, another searches the web, another analyses local files</li>
        <li><strong>Project audits</strong> &mdash; Multiple agents examine different aspects (code quality, security, documentation, performance)</li>
        <li><strong>Fee proposals</strong> &mdash; Research agent gathers market rates, writer agent drafts the proposal, reviewer checks quality</li>
        <li><strong>Board discussions</strong> &mdash; Multiple AI &ldquo;directors&rdquo; debate a strategic question from different perspectives</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="card card-warning">
        <h4>Agent Team Considerations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cost</strong> &mdash; Each agent in a team uses API tokens, so teams cost more than single-agent tasks</li>
          <li><strong>Complexity</strong> &mdash; For simple tasks, a single agent is faster and more efficient</li>
          <li><strong>Coordination</strong> &mdash; Agents may occasionally produce conflicting outputs that the lead must reconcile</li>
          <li><strong>Review still required</strong> &mdash; More agents does not mean less human review. You must still verify everything</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Memory &amp; Workflows</h2>
      </div>

      <p>A significant limitation of AI chat is that each new session starts from scratch &mdash; Claude does not remember what you discussed yesterday. Hillway solves this with <strong>Memory MCP</strong> and <strong>CLAUDE.md files</strong>, which give Claude persistent context across sessions.</p>

      <h3>How Memory Works</h3>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Memory MCP</h4>
        <p>The Memory MCP server stores important information as &ldquo;entities&rdquo; &mdash; structured pieces of knowledge that Claude can query at the start of any session. This means Claude can remember client preferences, project decisions, and important context without you having to repeat it every time.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Types of information stored in Memory:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Client information</strong> &mdash; preferences, history, contact details</li>
        <li><strong>Project decisions</strong> &mdash; architecture choices, approach decisions with rationale</li>
        <li><strong>Milestones</strong> &mdash; what has been completed, what is next</li>
        <li><strong>Risk registers</strong> &mdash; identified risks and mitigations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CLAUDE.md Files</h3>

      <p>Every project at Hillway has a <code class="inline">CLAUDE.md</code> file that gives Claude essential context about the project. When you start Claude Code in a project directory, it automatically reads this file.</p>

      <h3>Session Workflows</h3>

      <p>Hillway uses structured workflows to maintain continuity across sessions:</p>

      <div class="step-list">
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>Start of session</strong>
            <p>Claude reads CLAUDE.md and queries Memory MCP for relevant context. You pick up where you left off.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">2</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>During the session</strong>
            <p>Important decisions are stored in Memory. Files are saved regularly. Progress is tracked.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-number">3</div>
          <div class="step-content">
            <strong>End of session</strong>
            <p>CLAUDE.md is updated with current status. Work is committed to Git. Memory is updated with any new decisions.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Checkpoints and Handoffs</h3>

      <p>For long tasks that might span multiple sessions, Hillway uses checkpoints:</p>

      <div class="comparison-table">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Command</th>
              <th>What It Does</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="inline">/checkpoint</code></td>
              <td>Saves current task state to a checkpoint file + Memory. Safe to clear context after this.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="inline">/resume</code></td>
              <td>Reads the checkpoint and continues where you left off after a context clear.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="inline">/compact</code></td>
              <td>Compresses the current conversation to free up context space without losing important information.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Context Window Management</h4>
        <p>Claude has a limited context window (how much information it can hold in &ldquo;working memory&rdquo;). For long sessions with many files and extensive conversation, the context can fill up. Using <code class="inline">/checkpoint</code> before clearing context ensures nothing is lost. Think of it like saving your work before closing a document.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="try-this">
        <h4>Try This Now</h4>
        <p>Ask Claude Code what it knows about you and Hillway by saying: "What context do you have about me and about Hillway?" Notice how Claude can access information from Memory MCP and CLAUDE.md files without you providing it. This is persistent context in action.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card card-accent">
        <h4>Day 4 Summary</h4>
        <p>Today you learned about co-work mode for collaborative working, agent teams for complex parallel tasks, Hillway's library of custom skills, and how Memory MCP provides persistent context across sessions. These tools transform Claude Code from a simple Q&amp;A tool into an integrated working environment for property professionals.</p>
