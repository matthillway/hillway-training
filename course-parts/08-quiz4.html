        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="37" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about what makes co-work mode different from standard mode." data-hint2="Co-work mode is like pair-working &mdash; ongoing collaboration rather than sequential requests.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 1 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the key difference between co-work mode and standard Claude Code usage?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Co-work mode uses a different AI model</button>

            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Co-work mode is only for coding tasks</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Co-work mode does not require any human input</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Co-work mode</strong> transforms the interaction from sequential request-response into ongoing collaboration. You can guide, redirect, and refine as Claude works, like having a colleague working alongside you.</div>

          <div class="quiz-explanation">An <strong>agent team</strong> is a group of specialised AI agents, each with a specific role (researcher, analyst, writer, reviewer), coordinated by a lead agent.

          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Agent teams are best for complex, multi-faceted tasks</strong> that benefit from parallel processing or multiple perspectives. Simple tasks are more efficiently handled by a single agent &mdash; teams add cost and complexity that is not justified for straightforward work.</div>

          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Memory MCP</strong> stores important information as entities (client details, project decisions, milestones) that persist across sessions. This means Claude can remember context without you repeating it every time you start a new conversation.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="42" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about what CLAUDE.md files contain." data-hint2="These files provide project-specific context that Claude reads automatically when you start working in that directory.">

          <div class="quiz-explanation">A <strong>CLAUDE.md file</strong> provides essential project context &mdash; current status, key decisions, team information, and last working state.

          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Each agent uses API tokens independently.</strong> If you have 6 agents in a team, that is 6 times the token usage of a single agent. This is why teams should be reserved for complex tasks where the parallel processing genuinely adds value.</div>
