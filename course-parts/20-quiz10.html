        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="109" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about the key data protection principle for AI use." data-hint2="The principle says to share only the minimum personal data needed for the task.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 1 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the key UK GDPR principle that applies to using client data with Claude Code?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Data maximisation &mdash; share all available data for best results</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Data minimisation &mdash; only share the minimum personal data necessary</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Data destruction &mdash; delete all data after use</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Data publication &mdash; all data should be publicly available</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Data minimisation</strong> means only sharing the minimum personal data necessary for the specific task. If Claude does not need a client's home address to draft a market report, do not include it. Less data means less risk.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="110" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about which types of personal data should never be used with AI." data-hint2="Highly sensitive personal identifiers like NI numbers should never be shared with AI tools.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 2 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Which type of data must NEVER be input into Claude Code?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Commercial property addresses</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Lease terms and rental figures</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Business email addresses</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) National Insurance numbers and bank account details</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Personal financial identifiers</strong> like National Insurance numbers, bank account details, and credit card numbers must never be input into AI tools. Property data, business contacts, and lease terms are generally acceptable for professional use.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="111" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about what confirmation bias means in the context of AI prompts." data-hint2="The way you phrase a question can lead Claude to assume your conclusion is correct.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 3 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">How does confirmation bias appear in AI-assisted property analysis?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Framing a question that assumes a conclusion, e.g., "Why is this property undervalued?"</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Asking Claude to check its own work</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Using multiple data sources</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Requesting counter-arguments</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> occurs when your prompt assumes a conclusion. "Why is this property undervalued?" tells Claude to find evidence for undervaluation. A neutral prompt like "Assess whether this property is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued" produces more balanced analysis.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="112" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about the five RICS professional principles." data-hint2="This principle means you own the output once you approve it &mdash; AI error is not a defence.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 4 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Which RICS principle is most relevant when Claude Code produces an error that reaches a client?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Act with integrity</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Treat others with respect</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Take responsibility</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Promote trust in the profession</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Take responsibility.</strong> You are responsible for output that you approve and send. "AI error" is not a professional defence. The duty of care is the same whether you used AI or not. This is why thorough review of all AI output is non-negotiable.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="113" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about what Hillway's data arrangement with Anthropic provides." data-hint2="The arrangement includes protections about how data is handled, but does not remove your responsibilities.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 5 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What does Hillway's data processing arrangement with Anthropic mean in practice?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) You can share any data without concern</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Data is not used for AI training, is encrypted, and not shared &mdash; but you must still handle data carefully</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) All data is automatically deleted after 24 hours</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Anthropic guarantees 100% accuracy of all outputs</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The arrangement means data is <strong>not used for training, is encrypted, and is not shared with third parties</strong>. However, this does not eliminate your responsibility to handle data carefully. Data minimisation, client confidentiality, and professional care still apply.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="114" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about what the formal AI valuation rules require." data-hint2="The valuation opinion itself must always come from a qualified valuer, not AI.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 6 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">In RICS-compliant valuations, what role can AI play?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Data gathering, comparable analysis, and report drafting &mdash; but the valuation opinion must come from a qualified valuer</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) AI can produce the complete valuation including the final figure</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) AI is not permitted in any part of the valuation process</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) AI can sign the valuation report on behalf of the surveyor</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">AI can assist with <strong>data gathering, comparable analysis, and report drafting</strong>, but the valuation opinion must be formed by a qualified valuer. The signing surveyor must be able to justify every figure. Red Book requirements apply regardless of the tools used.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="115" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about how to reduce geographic bias in AI analysis." data-hint2="Providing specific local context helps Claude focus on the right market.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 7 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">How can you mitigate geographic bias when asking Claude about the Sheffield property market?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Ask about London instead, as there is more data</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Ignore any geographic differences</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Only use data from Claude's training set</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Explicitly specify the Sheffield submarket and provide local comparable data</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Specify the local submarket</strong> and provide local data. AI may default to London-centric analysis or national averages. By saying "Focus on the Sheffield S9 industrial submarket" and providing local comparables, you steer the analysis toward your actual market.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="116" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about what you should do when switching between clients." data-hint2="Mixing client data in the same session creates data protection and conflict risks.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 8 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What should you do when switching from Client A's work to Client B's work in Claude Code?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Continue in the same session to save time</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Ask Claude to forget the previous client's data</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Start a new session to prevent data mixing</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Use a different computer for each client</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Start a new session</strong> when switching clients. This prevents accidental data mixing (a data protection issue) and potential conflicts of interest. Claude Code sessions carry forward all context, so Client A's data would still be visible when working on Client B's matter.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="117" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about the responsibility chain at Hillway." data-hint2="The chain goes: Claude drafts &rarr; you review &rarr; senior approves &rarr; firm stands behind it.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 9 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">In Hillway's responsibility chain for AI-assisted work, what is your role as the reviewer?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Check formatting only</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Verify facts, apply professional judgement, and ensure quality before it goes for senior approval</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Forward everything to Matt without review</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Add your signature to whatever Claude produces</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">As the reviewer, you <strong>verify facts, apply professional judgement, and ensure quality</strong> before work goes for senior approval. This is where your professional skills are most valuable &mdash; catching errors, improving analysis, and ensuring the output meets RICS standards.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="118" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about why asking for the opposite view improves analysis quality." data-hint2="Asking Claude for counter-arguments reveals weaknesses in the analysis.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 10 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Why should you ask Claude Code for counter-arguments to your analysis?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) It reveals one-sided thinking and potential weaknesses in your position</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) It makes the output longer, which impresses clients</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) It is required by RICS for all reports</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) It tests whether Claude is working properly</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">Asking for counter-arguments <strong>reveals one-sided thinking and weaknesses</strong> in your position. This is valuable for rent reviews (anticipating the other side's arguments), investment analysis (identifying risks), and any professional advice where balance and thoroughness are important.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="119" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about the ongoing development plan from this section." data-hint2="The plan starts with building daily habits and gradually expanding to more complex applications.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 11 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">According to the development plan, what should you focus on in your first two weeks after completing this course?</div>

            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Using Claude Code daily for at least one real task to build confidence and habit</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The first two weeks should focus on <strong>building confidence through daily use</strong>. Start with familiar tasks (email drafting, meeting prep, simple research) and build the habit of incorporating Claude Code into your daily workflow. Complexity comes later.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="120" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about the core message of this entire course." data-hint2="The key principle is about the relationship between AI capability and human responsibility.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 12 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the single most important principle from this entire course?</div>

          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The core principle: <strong>AI is a powerful tool that amplifies your professional capabilities. Use it confidently, verify everything, and never stop learning.</strong> AI does not replace professional judgement &mdash; it enhances it. Your value comes from the combination of AI efficiency and human expertise.</div>
