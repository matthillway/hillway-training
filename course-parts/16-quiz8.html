      </div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; color: var(--gray-600); font-size: 14px;">Test your understanding of research, analysis, and fact-checking. Remember: up to 3 attempts per question with hints.</p>

      <div class="quiz-container" id="quiz-8-container">

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="85" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about the first step in the research strategy framework." data-hint2="Before gathering any data, you need to know exactly what you are looking for and why.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 1 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the first step in a structured research approach with Claude Code?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Run a web search immediately</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Define the specific research question</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Ask Claude to find everything about the topic</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Read all documents in the folder</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The first step is to <strong>define the specific research question</strong>. A clear, specific question like "What is the current ERV for Grade A office space in Sheffield city centre?" guides the research far more effectively than a vague request to "research Sheffield offices."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="86" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about which data sources come from official government databases." data-hint2="Official registers and statutory filings are most reliable. Web articles vary in quality.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 2 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">According to the trust gradient, which data source deserves the HIGHEST level of trust?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) A property blog post found via web search</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Claude's general knowledge about market trends</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) An anonymous comment on a property forum</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Data from official APIs like the VOA or Land Registry</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Official API data</strong> from VOA, Land Registry, EPC Register, and similar sources is the most reliable because it comes directly from official databases. Web articles and general AI knowledge should be treated with lower confidence and verified against primary sources.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="87" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about what the colour codes mean in risk assessment." data-hint2="RAG stands for Red (high risk), Amber (moderate concern), Green (no issues).">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 3 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">In a RAG-status due diligence report, what does an "Amber" rating indicate?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Moderate concern, manageable with appropriate action</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) No issues identified</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Critical issue requiring immediate escalation</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Data not available</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Amber indicates moderate concern</strong> that is manageable with appropriate action. Red means significant issues requiring further investigation. Green means no issues identified. This framework gives clients a quick visual summary of risk.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="88" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about what kind of information might indicate fabrication." data-hint2="One of the red flags is data that looks real but cannot be verified against any source.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 4 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Claude Code cites a "vacancy rate of exactly 4.27% for Sheffield industrial" without a source. What should this tell you?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) This is highly accurate AI analysis</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) This is from the VOA database</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Suspiciously precise numbers without sources are a red flag for AI fabrication</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) This matches published RICS data</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Suspiciously precise numbers without cited sources are a red flag</strong> for AI hallucination. Real market statistics come from specific reports with known methodologies. If Claude presents a precise figure without saying where it came from, treat it as unreliable until verified.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="89" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about what lower investment yields indicate." data-hint2="Lower yields mean higher prices, which investors pay for lower-risk properties.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 5 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">In investment analysis, what does a LOWER yield generally indicate?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Higher risk and lower quality</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Lower perceived risk and higher investor demand</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) The property needs refurbishment</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) The tenant is about to vacate</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Lower yields indicate lower perceived risk</strong> and higher investor demand. Investors accept lower returns (yields) for properties they consider safer &mdash; typically prime locations, strong tenants, and long unexpired lease terms. Higher yields suggest higher risk.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="90" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about what you should do when you know a fact is wrong." data-hint2="Your market knowledge is the ultimate test &mdash; if something sounds implausible, it probably is.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 6 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the "smell test" in fact-checking AI research?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Checking if the data has an expiry date</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Verifying the AI model version</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Running the same prompt multiple times</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Checking whether the conclusion makes sense given your professional knowledge of the market</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The <strong>smell test</strong> is applying your professional knowledge to check whether AI output is plausible. If Claude claims Sheffield prime industrial rents are &pound;50 psf, your market experience should tell you this is implausible. Professional knowledge is your most important verification tool.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="91" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about which data source provides floor areas and rateable values." data-hint2="This is the Valuation Office Agency &mdash; the official source for business rates data.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 7 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Which data source provides the most reliable floor area measurements for commercial property?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) VOA (Valuation Office Agency)</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Google Maps</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) The property listing website</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) The tenant's own estimate</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The <strong>VOA</strong> provides official floor area measurements used for business rates assessments. While not always perfectly accurate, they are measured by qualified valuers and provide the most consistent, official data source for commercial floor areas.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="92" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about the purpose of asking Claude to review its own work." data-hint2="The self-check prompt asks Claude to identify its own uncertainties and potential errors.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 8 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">What is the purpose of the "self-check" prompt?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) To make Claude rewrite its entire response</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) To test if Claude is still working properly</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) To ask Claude to identify its own uncertainties, potentially outdated data, and assumptions</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) To generate a second opinion from a different AI model</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation">The self-check prompt asks Claude to <strong>honestly assess its own confidence levels</strong>, flag potentially outdated information, and identify assumptions that need verification. This helps you focus your manual fact-checking on the areas where Claude is least confident.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="93" data-type="mc" data-answer="b" data-hint1="Think about what happens when you use AI-generated data to validate other AI claims." data-hint2="This creates a closed loop where errors can compound rather than being caught.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 9 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Why is "circular reasoning" a red flag in AI-generated research?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) It means Claude is going in circles and will never finish</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) It means AI-generated data is being used to validate other AI-generated conclusions, compounding potential errors</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) It means the research covers the same topic twice</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) It means the analysis is too long</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Circular reasoning</strong> occurs when AI-generated data validates other AI-generated conclusions, creating a closed loop where errors compound. Always verify AI claims against independent, primary sources rather than other AI outputs.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="94" data-type="mc" data-answer="d" data-hint1="Think about what a correlation between two trends actually proves." data-hint2="Just because two things happen at the same time does not mean one caused the other.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 10 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Claude notes that "as new development increased, industrial rents rose by 25%." What should you consider?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) New development always causes rent increases</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Claude has found a proven causal relationship</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) This is definitive evidence for a client report</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Correlation does not imply causation &mdash; both might be driven by strong demand</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Correlation does not imply causation.</strong> New development and rent increases might both be caused by a third factor (strong occupier demand). Your market knowledge is essential for interpreting the "why" behind statistical trends. AI identifies patterns; you provide the professional explanation.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="95" data-type="mc" data-answer="a" data-hint1="Think about what cross-referencing means." data-hint2="If only one source reports something, it might be unreliable. Multiple sources increase confidence.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 11 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">Why should you cross-reference findings from multiple data sources?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) If only one source reports something, it may be unreliable; multiple sources increase confidence</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) To make your report look more impressive</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Because RICS requires exactly three sources for every fact</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) To increase the word count of your analysis</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Cross-referencing increases confidence</strong> in your findings. If multiple independent sources report the same data, it is more likely to be accurate. If only one source reports something (especially an AI-generated finding), treat it with caution until verified.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question" data-question="96" data-type="mc" data-answer="c" data-hint1="Think about the five steps in the verification framework." data-hint2="The steps are: check source, verify facts, check arithmetic, smell test, check freshness.">
          <div class="quiz-q-number">Question 12 of 12</div>
          <div class="quiz-q-text">In the verification framework, what does "check freshness" mean?</div>
          <div class="quiz-options">
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="a">(a) Verify that Claude is using the latest AI model</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="b">(b) Check that the document has not been tampered with</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="c">(c) Verify that data and statistics are current and not outdated</button>
            <button class="quiz-option" data-value="d">(d) Ensure the prompt was submitted recently</button>
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-hint"></div>
          <div class="quiz-explanation"><strong>Check freshness</strong> means verifying that data is current. Claude may cite older statistics from its training data. For market analysis, ensure transaction dates, vacancy rates, and other statistics reflect the current market, not data from a year ago.</div>
