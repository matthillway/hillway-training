        <h2>Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that dramatically improves Claude's accuracy on analytical tasks by asking it to show its reasoning step by step, rather than jumping directly to an answer.</p>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Why Chain-of-Thought Works</h4>
        <p>When Claude "thinks out loud," it breaks complex problems into smaller steps, catches its own errors, and produces more accurate results. This mirrors how professionals work &mdash; a surveyor does not jump from raw data to a final valuation. They work through comparables, adjustments, weighting, and methodology step by step.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Basic Chain-of-Thought</h3>

      <p>The simplest way to invoke chain-of-thought is to add "Think step by step" or "Show your working" to your prompt:</p>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">Without CoT (Less Accurate)</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">What ERV would you recommend for a 5,000 sq ft office at 22 Division Street, Sheffield, based on these comparables? [data]</div>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">With CoT (More Accurate)</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">Based on these comparables, what ERV would you recommend for a 5,000 sq ft office at 22 Division Street, Sheffield? Think step by step:

1. First, assess each comparable for relevance (location, size, quality, timing)
2. Adjust each to an effective rent basis
3. Weight the comparables based on relevance
4. Apply any necessary adjustments for the subject property
5. State your recommended ERV range with justification

[data]</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Structured Chain-of-Thought for Property Analysis</h3>

      <p>For property-specific analysis, structure the chain of thought to match professional methodology:</p>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">Rent Review CoT</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">Analyse this rent review position step by step:

Step 1: LEASE TERMS - Summarise the relevant lease provisions (review clause, basis, assumptions)
Step 2: MARKET CONTEXT - Assess the current market for this property type and location
Step 3: COMPARABLE EVIDENCE - Analyse each comparable, noting strengths and weaknesses
Step 4: ADJUSTMENTS - Apply time, size, quality, and location adjustments
Step 5: WEIGHTING - Weight the adjusted comparables and explain your reasoning
Step 6: ERV RECOMMENDATION - State a recommended range and preferred figure
Step 7: RISKS - Identify risks to this position and potential counter-arguments

      <h3>When to Use Chain-of-Thought</h3>

        <h4>Try This Now</h4>
        <p>Take a comparable evidence analysis task. First, ask Claude for a straight answer without chain-of-thought. Then ask the same question with structured CoT steps.

      <div class="card card-accent">

    <!-- Section 24: Few-Shot & Personas -->

      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">24</span>
        <h2>Few-Shot Learning &amp; Personas</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Two powerful techniques that work together: <strong>few-shot learning</strong> (showing Claude examples of what you want) and <strong>persona engineering</strong> (defining who Claude should be for a specific task).</p>

      <h3>Few-Shot Learning</h3>

      <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>What is Few-Shot Learning?</h4>
        <p>Instead of describing what you want, you <strong>show</strong> Claude by providing examples. Claude learns the pattern from your examples and applies it to new inputs. "Few-shot" means providing a small number (1&ndash;5) of examples.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Zero-Shot vs One-Shot vs Few-Shot</h4>

      <div class="comparison-table">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Approach</th>
              <th>Examples Given</th>
              <th>Best For</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Zero-shot</strong></td>
              <td>None &mdash; just describe what you want</td>
              <td>Simple, well-understood tasks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>One-shot</strong></td>
              <td>One example</td>
              <td>Style matching, format consistency</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Few-shot</strong></td>
              <td>2&ndash;5 examples</td>
              <td>Complex patterns, professional tone matching, specialised formats</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">Few-Shot Example: Property Descriptions</div>
        <div class="prompt-text">Here are three examples of how I write property descriptions for our client reports:

Example 1: "The property comprises a modern, detached industrial unit of steel portal frame construction with profiled metal cladding to walls and roof. The unit provides clear span warehouse accommodation with an eaves height of 8 metres."

Example 2: "The premises consist of a ground floor retail unit within a Victorian mid-terrace building of traditional brick construction under a pitched slate roof. The unit provides open-plan sales accommodation with an ancillary storage area to the rear."

Example 3: "The subject property is a self-contained first floor office suite within a 1990s purpose-built office building. The accommodation provides open-plan workspace with perimeter cellular offices and a central meeting room."

Now write a property description for: a 1970s semi-detached light industrial unit, single-storey, with blockwork walls, corrugated roof, one roller shutter door, small office at the front, approximately 3,000 sq ft total.</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Persona Engineering</h3>

      <p>A persona goes beyond a simple role assignment. It defines Claude's expertise, communication style, knowledge focus, and even personality traits:</p>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">Basic Role vs Detailed Persona</div>
        <div class="prompt-text"><strong>Basic role:</strong> "You are a surveyor."

<strong>Detailed persona:</strong> "You are a senior RICS-chartered commercial property surveyor with 25 years of experience in the South Yorkshire industrial and logistics market. You specialise in rent reviews and lease renewals for institutional landlord clients. Your communication style is precise, data-driven, and confident. You always qualify opinions with reference to evidence. You are aware of current market trends including the growth of last-mile logistics and the impact of ESG requirements on industrial rents."</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Combining Techniques</h3>

      <p>The most effective prompts often combine multiple techniques. Here is an example combining persona, few-shot, and chain-of-thought:</p>

      <div class="prompt-example">
        <div class="prompt-label">Combined Technique</div>
        <div class="prompt-text"><strong>[Persona]</strong> You are a senior RICS-qualified investment surveyor advising institutional clients on commercial property acquisitions in Sheffield.

<strong>[Few-shot]</strong> Here is how I typically structure investment analysis for my clients:

"Property: [address]. The subject property is currently let to [tenant] at a passing rent of &pound;X pa, reflecting a capital value of &pound;Y at a NIY of Z%. The reversionary position, based on an ERV of &pound;A pa, suggests upside/downside of B%..."

<strong>[Chain-of-thought]</strong> Now analyse this investment opportunity step by step:
1. Summarise the investment characteristics
2. Calculate the NIY and reversionary yield
3. Assess tenant covenant strength
4. Identify risks and opportunities
5. Provide an investment recommendation

      <div class="try-this">
        <h4>Try This Now</h4>
        <p>Create a detailed persona for Claude that matches your own professional context at Hillway. Include your level of experience (apprentice surveyor), your focus areas, the types of clients you work with, and the market you operate in. Then use this persona to generate a market commentary on Sheffield industrial property. Compare the output with a generic "you are a surveyor" prompt.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card card-accent">
        <h4>Section Summary</h4>
        <p>Few-shot learning teaches Claude by example &mdash; show it what you want rather than describing it. Persona engineering defines Claude's expertise, style, and focus for a specific task. Combining these with chain-of-thought produces the highest quality output.</p>
